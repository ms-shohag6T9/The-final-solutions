    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>My name is <b>Mohammad Sharowar</b>. I am a young, energetic, and curious individual who always tries to explore new things and improve myself. I am passionate about learning, especially in fields like <i>technology</i>, <i>creativity</i>, and <i>business</i>. I have a deep interest in web development, video editing, and social media content creation. Recently, I’ve also started focusing on building a small business related to seasonal fruits, such as Dinajpur’s famous lychees, and I enjoy working on creative ways to market them online. I always try to learn from my surroundings and people I interact with. I believe in honesty, dedication, and hard work, and I try to apply these values in everything I do. I love spending time with family, exploring nature, and dreaming big about the future. One of my goals is to become financially independent while doing something meaningful. I also enjoy sharing knowledge with others, helping people online, and staying connected with my culture and community. Life is full of possibilities, and I try to make the most out of every moment by staying positive, active, and focused on growth.</p>
